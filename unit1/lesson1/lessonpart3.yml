  ## Code Challenge: HTML buttons


  We call the different HTML tags on a page, “elements”. &#x20;


  Elements are the building blocks of any web page and are used to define
  formatting, structure, and all the things on a page. &#x20;


  An element is comprised of:&#x20;


  * A start tag denoted by “less than” and “greater than” symbols around a tag
  name: <*tag name*>&#x20;

  * An end tag that looks like the start tag but with a slash before the tag
  name: \</*tag name*>&#x20;

  * Some content in between the start and end tags


  > \<tag\_name> Some stuff in here \</tag\_name>


  Button elements look like:


  ```

  <button> Press me! </button>

  ```


  Try copying and pasting the code above or typing in the code for a button
  element into the index.html file. &#x20;


  Place the code between the \<div> element on the page.


  Press the green Play button to see what your button looks like in the Preview
  window.
