  ## JavaScript Functions


  It’s great that we have a nice looking button on our page, but when you click
  it in the Preview window, nothing happens! &#x20;


  To add an action to our button click event, we need to define an attribute on
  our button element. &#x20;


  An HTML attribute is a way of describing and defining certain properties of an
  element.  Just like adjectives like “slimy” and “bright yellow” may define a
  noun like “slug”, attributes help to describe HTML elements on a page.


  You can add attributes to the starting tag name in your HTML element, like
  this:


  > \<tag\_name attribute=“attribute\_value”> Some stuff in here \</tag\_name>


  We are going to add the “onclick” attribute to our button element.  This will
  let us know what to do when our button is clicked.  The onclick attribute
  needs to point to a JavaScript function which will define what action to take.
