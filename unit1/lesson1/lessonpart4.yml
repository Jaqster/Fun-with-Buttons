  ## HTML Attributes


  It’s great that we have a nice looking button on our page, but when you click
  it in the Preview window, nothing happens! &#x20;


  To add an action to our button click event, we need to define an attribute on
  our button element. &#x20;


  An HTML attribute is a way of describing and defining certain properties of an
  element.  Just like adjectives like “slimy” and “bright yellow” may define a
  noun like “slug”, attributes help to describe HTML elements on a page.


  You can add attributes to the starting tag name in your HTML element, like
  this:


  > \<tag\_name **attribute=“attribute\_value”**> Some stuff in here
  \</tag\_name>


  We are going to add the “onclick” attribute to our button element.  This will
  let us know what to do when our button is clicked.  The onclick attribute
  needs to point to a JavaScript function which will define what action to take.


  ```

  <button onclick=“doSomething()”> Press me! </button>

  ```


  In this case, let’s make our button change the background color of the page. 
  Try copying and pasting the code below or typing the code into the
  ***index.html*** file replacing your current button element.  This will create
  a button with an onclick attribute that points to a JavaScript function called
  “showColor()” and with a “Color” label instead of “Press me!”.


  ```

  <button onclick=“showColor()”> Color </button>

  ```


  Press the green Play button to see how your button appears in the Preview
  window.  What happens when you click on it?


  Nothing!  That's because we haven't defined the "ShowColor()" function.  We'll
  do that on the next page.
